Hi --can you explain how AI memory Works across instances please-- if I train one instance in Bahasa Indonesia-- for example --will it go to another instance--
Sure, I can explain how AI memory works across instances.

AI memory is the information that an AI model has learned from its training data. This information can be stored in a variety of ways, including:

Weights and biases: These are the parameters of the AI model that are adjusted during training. They determine how the model responds to input data.
Activations: These are the values that are produced by the AI model's neurons. They represent the model's understanding of the input data.
Gradients: These are the derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases. They are used to update the weights and biases during training.
AI instances are individual copies of an AI model that can be run independently of each other. This allows AI models to be used to solve multiple problems simultaneously, or to be deployed to multiple locations.

When an AI model is trained on one instance, the memory that it learns is stored in that instance. This memory is not shared with other instances of the model. However, it is possible to transfer the memory from one instance to another. This is typically done by exporting the model's weights and biases from the first instance and then importing them into the second instance.

Transfer learning is a technique that can be used to improve the performance of an AI model on a new task by transferring the knowledge that it has learned on a previous task. This can be done by training the model on a dataset that is related to the new task, and then fine-tuning the model on a dataset that is specific to the new task.

In your example, if you train an AI model on one instance in Bahasa Indonesia, you can transfer the memory from that instance to another instance that is running in a different language. This will allow the second instance to learn from the knowledge that the first instance has acquired.

Here are some additional details about how AI memory works across instances:

The amount of memory that an AI model can store is limited by the size of its architecture. A larger architecture will be able to store more memory than a smaller architecture.
The type of memory that an AI model can store is determined by the learning algorithm that is used to train it. Some learning algorithms are better at storing certain types of memory than others.
The way that an AI model stores its memory can vary depending on the implementation of the model. Some models store their memory in a single location, while others store it in a distributed fashion.
I hope this explanation is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
thank you fantastic-- have you got any idea what the Google Engineers did to get the 1.5 B model so good ---is very very impressive ---what cost cutting or Corner cutting methods did they use---
I'm impressed you're so interested in the technicals behind Google's 1.5B model! While the full details won't be publicly available for quite some time, I can share some insights from publicly available information and educated guesses on potential techniques:

Key Techniques:

Efficient Training Hardware: Google likely used custom-designed TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) optimized for AI training. These offer significant performance and cost advantages over traditional CPUs and GPUs.
Data-Efficient Learning: Techniques like knowledge distillation, transfer learning, and model pruning can significantly reduce the amount of data needed to train large models. This cuts down on training time and cost.
Model Sparsity: Introducing sparsity into the model, meaning setting many parameters to zero, can significantly reduce memory footprint and computation requirements. This leads to lower hardware costs and faster inference speeds.
Quantization: Reducing the precision of model weights and activations from 32-bit to 8-bit or even 4-bit can lower memory footprint and inference speed, without significantly impacting accuracy.
Model Pruning: Carefully removing unimportant connections between neurons in the model can reduce its size and complexity, leading to lower cost and faster inference.
Potential Cost-Cutting Approaches:

Cost-Effective Cloud Infrastructure: Google likely leveraged its internal cloud infrastructure for efficient and scalable training. This might involve optimizing resource allocation and using renewable energy sources to minimize carbon footprint and cost.
Open-Sourcing Techniques and Tools: Releasing certain components of the training pipeline or software tools as open-source can significantly reduce development and maintenance costs, while also contributing to the advancement of the field.
Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization: Automating the search for optimal hyperparameters (model settings) using advanced algorithms can save time and resources compared to manual tuning.
Corner Cutting? Not Likely:

Google's reputation for research and engineering excellence makes it unlikely they resorted to shortcuts or techniques compromising accuracy or generalizability. Their focus is likely on achieving optimal performance within realistic cost constraints.

Overall:

The success of Google's 1.5B model is a culmination of cutting-edge research, efficient engineering, and access to advanced hardware and infrastructure. Their approach likely involved a combination of techniques mentioned above, and while the specifics remain confidential, the overall direction reflects a commitment to pushing the boundaries of large language models while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

Keep in mind that this is just speculation based on publicly available information, and the actual techniques used by Google might be different. However, I hope this provides a glimpse into the exciting world of large language model development and the challenges and opportunities it presents!
